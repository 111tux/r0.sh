#| name		r0.sh
#| version      0.1 alpha
#| author	111tux
#| what		sh script for building own linux router with a high requirement on network security on all ISO-OSI network layers
#| howto run	chmod +x ./r0.sh;./r0.sh
#| tested on	
#|  hardware	pi4
#|  os		debian

#> why
#| no ads on all network devices (:
#| full control of my home network
#| secure my home network
#| setup network from scratch
#| security_research > understanding of how things (work | are implemented)
#| good project for starting with a more complex home network
#| cheaper than commercial routers

#> why debian
#| debian is (free & opensource) software and will always be 100% free
#| debian is the largest community-run linux distribution
#| a lot of linux distributions are debian-based, eg ubuntu,kali,mint
#| debian runs on nearly every processor architecture, thus r0.sh runs also on nearly every cpu architecture (if this is wrong, pls correct me)
#| ideal for servers, because it's extreme stable
#| debian names their versions after toy story names

#> research
#| !!! why static route to next hop is better, as static route to (broadcast | local) interface:
#| https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/7220/static-routes-numerical-next-hop-vs-interface
#| 
#| interesting article about ipv6
#| https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/01/ipv6-celebrates-its-20th-birthday-by-reaching-10-percent-deployment/


#> FUTURE WORK
#|  implement ipv6
#|  BIND9 as main DNS server
#|  write (complete & secure) ssh cfg
#|  performance benchmark; network speed optimization
#|  display network information via 4-inch miuzei display
#|  arp spoof detection

#| OPTION_0: PYHOLE
#|           Network-wide ad blocking via your own Linux hardware
#|           The Pi-holeÂ® is a DNS sinkhole that protects your devices from unwanted content, without installing any client-side software.
#|           https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole

#| OPTION_1: BIND9 (Berkeley Internet Name Daemon)
#|           BIND, or named, is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet.
#|           It performs both of the main DNS server roles, acting as an authoritative name server for domains,
#|           and acting as a recursive resolver in the network. As of 2015, it is the most widely used domain name server software
#|           and is the de facto standard on Unix-like operating systems
#|           https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIND
#|           https://www.linuxtechi.com/install-configure-bind-9-dns-server-ubuntu-debian/
#|           FUTURE WORK - L0L

#| OPTION_2: PYHOLE uses local BIND instance as main DNS server
#|           OBVIOUSLY ALSO FUTURE WORK

#| EXTRA:    running BIND9 as (internal & external) DNS server
#|           https://www.howtoforge.com/two_in_one_dns_bind9_views
#|           [i will create a dedicated external BIND9 instance, but r0.sh will handle the port forwarding for this]
